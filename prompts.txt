"""Implement a self-supervised U-Net vascular segmentation prototype using PyTorch with these specifications:

Architecture Requirements:

U-Net base with 4 encoder-decoder stages
Depth-wise separable convolutions for transparent feature learning
Adaptive receptive field blocks at skip connections
Triple-output head (vessel core, boundary, background)
Training Strategy:

Input: 512x512 patches from single RGB image
Augmentation Pipeline:
Elastic deformations (σ=15, α=35)
Multi-spectrum illumination variations
Acrylic material-aware texture synthesis
Anisotropic diffusion-based edge preservation
Self-supervision Mechanics:

Structural consistency loss (SSIM + Gradient magnitude)
Geometric prior loss (vessel continuity regularization)
Morphology-guided pseudo labeling:
a) Hessian-based vesselness initialization
b) Conditional random field refinement
c) Boundary-aware label propagation
Optimization Configuration:

Hybrid loss: 0.4Dice + 0.3Contrastive + 0.3*Topological
AdamW optimizer (lr=1e-4 with cosine decay)
Gradient centralization
Mixed precision training
Include these components:

Material-aware preprocessing module
Interactive prediction visualizer
Vascular topology validator
Memory-efficient patch inference
Implementation Notes:

Use PyTorch-GradCAM for uncertainty visualization
Apply vessel diameter-adaptive inference
Include synthetic shadow augmentation
Optimize for single-image convergence"""
